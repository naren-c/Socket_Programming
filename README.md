# Socket_Programming

Our project is encryption/decryption using socket programming in Python. Socket programming is about the connection between client and server or many clients for data communication, networking and data transfer. The network formed between the nodes is known as sockets. 
In our project, we have used Caeser Cipher to encrypt and decrypt our messages. We have a client and server in our project and the server shows which client is connected for encryption/decryption. The server also shows the messages sent and received from the client. We have set the key value of encryption as 5, which means if we want to encrypt the letter ‘a’ the output will be ‘f’. The same way, a message can be decrypted, where ‘f’ gives the output ‘a’.
